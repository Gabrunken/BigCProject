# BigCProject
 A game engine for the C language.<br />
 Inside the project you'll find the engine source code, as well as the full editor software.<br />
 The editor is powered by the engine and it's an intuitive way to interact with it and<br />
 eases the development process.

# Folder structure
 "editor" -> the editor software, a helping hand on developing your game.
 "build" -> the source code built and ready to be linked<br />
 "deps" -> the dependencies used by the software<br />
 "examples" -> some simple programs to show what can be done at superficial level by the engine<br />
 "include" -> the BigC header (.h) files<br />
 "notes" -> what i could improve upon or stuff i should remember and i need to write down<br />
 "src" -> BigC source (.c) files

# Building
 Building the software isnt mandatory since it is ready inside "build",<br />
 altho it can be modified as you wish, and the build and build_debug batch<br />
 files should be ran after the changes.<br />
 build.bat is used for the release version of the software<br />
 build_debug.bat is a bit slower since it includes debug code and logs any type of relevant information
