# BigCProject
 A small game engine for the C language

# Folder structure
 "build" -> the source code built and ready to be linked
 "deps" -> the dependencies used by the software
 "examples" -> some simple programs to show what can be done at superficial level by the engine
 "include" -> the BigC header (.h) files
 "notes" -> what i could improve upon or stuff i should remember and i need to write down
 "src" -> BigC source (.c) files

# Building
 Building the software isnt mandatory since it is ready inside "build",
 altho it can be modified as you wish, and the build and build_debug batch
 files should be ran after the changes.
 build.bat is used for the release version of the software
 build_debug.bat is a bit slower since it includes debug code and logs any type of relevant information
